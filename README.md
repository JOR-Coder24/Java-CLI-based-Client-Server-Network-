The program is a fairly simple implementation of the client server model designed in Java.
The software written implements a chat server and client program and uses Java socket programming, which provides a communication mechanism between 2 or more computers on a network using TCP/IP. The server listens to a specified port number (in this instance, port number 2468 but this can be changed before running it) and creates separate thread for each client to handle the communication. 
The system runs through a Command-Line Interface.
